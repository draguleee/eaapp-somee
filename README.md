# Testing the eaapp-somee website using Selenium & .NET

## Project Overview  
This repository contains automated UI test scripts written in C# language, using Selenium WebDriver.  
It demonstrates best practices for writing, organizing, and executing UI automation tests for web applications.  


## Structure
```
eaapp-somee/  
├── pages
├── tests
├── utilities
├── data
├── models
└── other configuration files
```

* `pages`: Classes that implement the POM Design Pattern, describing the web pages, its elements and the methods for interacting with the UI.  
* `tests`: Test classes which uses the classes from pages and the models from `models` to execute different testing scenarios.  
* `utilities`: Classes that contain Extension Methods.  
* `data`: Test data that can be loaded by tests and used to generate parameterized test cases.  
* `models`: Data model classes used in tests, which make it easier to map test input data (from external sources) into a usable format, using Deserialization.  
* **Other files**: .csproj files, the solution file (.sln), and the bin/ / obj/ directories (generated by .NET during build).
